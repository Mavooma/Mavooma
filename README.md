👋 Hi there! I’m Vuyelwa Mavuma, known as 'Mavooma' online.

🌍 Based in South Africa, I’m a **Web Developer** with a passion for building engaging and user-friendly applications. I have expertise in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React**, and I’m diving into relational databases with MySQL and Node.js.

💻 I’m currently working on a variety of projects, including a **personal portfolio** and a **blog website**, where I aim to blend aesthetics with functionality.

🎓 I hold a **Diploma in Film and Television**, along with certifications from **SheCodes**, **MTN Skills Academy** and the **Power Learn Project(PLP)**, which fuels my creativity in web design and content creation.
